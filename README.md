This was my final project for a class I took at IU where we read the entirety of Dante's Divine Comedy. It's a video game recreation of the 13th canto in Inferno.

I made the game in Unity (C#), and built it to WebGL. It is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and served via a Go HTTP server. The domain name was registered with AWS Route 53.

Music from: https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/music.html (search Gregorian Chant)
